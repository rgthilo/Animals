Animal Groupings

blah blah, testing out GitHub and working on a small program my brother thought of while at work one night. 

Also, The correct plural form of platypus is platypodes, not platypi. Platy- derives from greek meaning 'flat' or 'broad' And a grouping of platypodes is a puddle. Apparently a grouping of platypus is called a puddle.
